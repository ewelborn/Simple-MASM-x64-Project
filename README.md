# Simple MASM x64 Project
This project was developed for use in my junior-level computer architecture course - I used this as a sample project to show the students what I expected from them. The code is written in x86-64 MASM and can be assembled using Visual Studio.

The project was developed in three phases. In phase 1, the students proposed an idea for their semester project and wrote a prototype in a high-level language. In phase 2, the students took their prototype from phase 1 and used it as a template to write their x86 assembly code. In phase 3, the students introduced at least two optimizations to their project and benchmarked their code to see the result of their optimizations.
